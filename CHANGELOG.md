## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- Removed custom formatting for QuerySets and iterables in shell output. QuerySets now display as `<QuerySet [...]>` and lists show their standard `repr()` instead of truncated displays with "... and X more items". This makes output consistent with standard Django/Python shell behavior and should hopefully not confused the robots.

### Fixed

- Django shell no longer shows `None` after print statements. Expression values are now only displayed when code doesn't print output, matching Python script execution behavior.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Comprehensive logging for debugging MCP/LLM interactions
- `--debug` flag for the `mcp_shell` management command to enable detailed logging
- Request and client ID tracking in server logs

### Changed

- **Internal**: Refactored results to use separate dataclasses and a tagged union
- Changed to using `contextlib` and its stdout/stderr output redirection context managers when executing code
- Swapped out `.split("\n")` usage for `.splitlines()` for better cross-platform line ending handling (h/t to [@jefftriplett] for the tip ðŸŽ‰)

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Django management command `mcp_shell` for MCP server integration
- `django_shell` MCP tool for executing Python code in persistent Django shell
- `django_reset` MCP tool for clearing session state
