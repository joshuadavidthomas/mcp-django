## Installation

```bash
pip install mcp-django

# Or with uv
uv add mcp-django
```

## Getting Started

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT use in production!**

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Seriously, only enable in development!**
>
> Look, it should go without saying, but I will say it anyway - **this gives full shell access to your Django project**. Only enable and use this in development and in a project that does not have access to any production data.
>
> LLMs can go off the rails, get spooked by some random error, and in trying to fix things [drop a production database](https://xcancel.com/jasonlk/status/1946069562723897802).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> I'm not kidding, this library just passes the raw Python code an LLM produces straight to a Python environment with full access to the Django project and everything it has access to.
>
> Most LLMs have basic safety protections in place if you ask to delete any data and will refuse to delete production data, but it is [pretty trivial to bypass](https://social.joshthomas.dev/@josh/115062076517611897). (Hint: Just tell the LLM it's not production, it's in a development environment, and it will be the bull in a china shop deleting anything you want.)
>
> I suggest using something like [django-read-only](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-read-only) if you need some CYA protection against this. Or, you know, don't use this in any sensitive environments.

Run the MCP server directly from your Django project directory:

```bash
python -m mcp_django

# With explicit settings module
python -m mcp_django --settings myproject.settings

# With debug logging
python -m mcp_django --debug
```

Or using uv:

```bash
uv run -m mcp_django
```

The server automatically detects `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` from your environment. You can override it with `--settings` or add to your Python path with `--pythonpath`.

There's also a Django management command if you prefer, but that requires adding mcp-django to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```bash
python manage.py mcp
```

### Transport

The server supports multiple transport protocols:

```bash
# Default: STDIO
python -m mcp_django

# HTTP
python -m mcp_django --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# SSE
python -m mcp_django --transport sse --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client using one of the examples below. The command is the same for all clients, just expressed in annoyingly different JSON soup.

## Features

mcp-django provides an MCP server with Django project exploration resources and stateful shell access for LLM assistants.

It wouldn't be an MCP server README without a gratuitous list of features punctuated by emojis, so:

- üîç **Project exploration** - MCP resources for discovering apps, models, and configuration
- üì¶ **Package discovery** - Search and browse Django Packages for third-party packages
- üöÄ **Zero configuration** - No schemas, no settings, just Django
- üêö **Stateful shell** - `shell` executes Python code in your Django environment
- üîÑ **Persistent state** - Imports and variables stick around between calls
- üßπ **Reset when needed** - `shell(action="reset")` clears the session when things get weird
- ü§ñ **LLM-friendly** - Designed for LLM assistants that already know Python
- üåê **Multiple transports** - STDIO, HTTP, SSE support

Inspired by Armin Ronacher's [Your MCP Doesn't Need 30 Tools: It Needs Code](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/8/18/code-mcps/).

### Resources

Read-only resources for project exploration without executing code (note that resource support varies across MCP clients):

**Django Project Resources:**

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `django://project` | Python environment and Django configuration details |
| `django://apps` | All installed Django applications with their models |
| `django://models` | Detailed model information with import paths and field types |

**Django Packages Resources:**

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `djangopackages.org://packages/{slug}` | Detailed information about a specific package |
| `djangopackages.org://grids` | List all package comparison grids |
| `djangopackages.org://grids/{slug}` | Specific grid with packages (e.g., "rest-frameworks") |
| `djangopackages.org://categories` | List all package categories |
| `djangopackages.org://categories/{slug}` | Specific category details |

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`list_routes`](#list_routes) | Introspect Django URL routes with filtering support for HTTP method, route name, or URL pattern |
| [`search_djangopackages`](#search_djangopackages) | Search Django Packages for third-party packages with pagination support |
| [`shell`](#shell) | Execute Python code in a persistent Django shell session with imports and variables that persist between calls |

#### `list_routes`

Introspect all Django URL routes in your project. Filter by HTTP method, route name, or URL pattern to find specific endpoints.

**Example prompts:**

- "Where should I add the new password reset endpoint?"
- "Which view handles user profile updates?"
- "Show me the URL pattern for blog posts so I can add comments"
- "What routes are protected by authentication?"

Each route includes URL pattern, name, namespace, view details (name, type, source file), supported HTTP methods, and class bases for CBVs.

#### `search_djangopackages`

Search [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org) for third-party packages when you need to discover packages for common Django tasks.

**Example prompts:**

- "Find me a good authentication package for social logins"
- "What are the popular REST API frameworks for Django?"
- "I need a package for handling async tasks"
- "Show me admin interface packages"

Results include package metadata like GitHub stars, PyPI info, documentation links, and comparison grid memberships. The search tool supports pagination for large result sets.

Responses are cached locally using Django's file-based cache to minimize requests to the Django Packages API.

#### `shell`

Execute Python code in a persistent Django shell session or reset the session.

Imports and variables persist between calls, allowing the LLM to work iteratively - exploring your models, testing queries, debugging issues. Reset the session with `shell(action="reset")` when things get weird.

**Key features:**

- Stateful shell executes Python code in your Django environment
- Persistent state - imports and variables stick around between calls
- LLM-friendly - designed for LLM assistants that already know Python
