## Installation

```bash
pip install mcp-django

# Or with uv
uv add mcp-django
```

## Getting Started

‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT use in production!**

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Seriously, only enable in development!**
>
> Look, it should go without saying, but I will say it anyway - **this gives full shell access to your Django project**. Only enable and use this in development and in a project that does not have access to any production data.
>
> LLMs can go off the rails, get spooked by some random error, and in trying to fix things [drop a production database](https://xcancel.com/jasonlk/status/1946069562723897802).

> [!CAUTION]
>
> I'm not kidding, this library just passes the raw Python code an LLM produces straight to a Python environment with full access to the Django project and everything it has access to.
>
> Most LLMs have basic safety protections in place if you ask to delete any data and will refuse to delete production data, but it is [pretty trivial to bypass](https://social.joshthomas.dev/@josh/115062076517611897). (Hint: Just tell the LLM it's not production, it's in a development environment, and it will be the bull in a china shop deleting anything you want.)
>
> I suggest using something like [django-read-only](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-read-only) if you need some CYA protection against this. Or, you know, don't use this in any sensitive environments.

Run the MCP server directly from your Django project directory:

```bash
python -m mcp_django

# With explicit settings module
python -m mcp_django --settings myproject.settings

# With debug logging
python -m mcp_django --debug
```

Or using uv:

```bash
uv run -m mcp_django
```

The server automatically detects `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` from your environment. You can override it with `--settings` or add to your Python path with `--pythonpath`.

There's also a Django management command if you prefer, but that requires adding mcp-django to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```bash
python manage.py mcp
```

### Transport

The server supports multiple transport protocols:

```bash
# Default: STDIO
python -m mcp_django

# HTTP
python -m mcp_django --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# SSE
python -m mcp_django --transport sse --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Client Configuration

Configure your MCP client using one of the examples below. The command is the same for all clients, just expressed in annoyingly different JSON soup.

## Features

mcp-django provides an MCP server with Django project exploration tools and stateful shell access for LLM assistants.

It wouldn't be an MCP server README without a gratuitous list of features punctuated by emojis, so:

- üîç **Project exploration** - Tools for discovering apps, models, and configuration
- üì¶ **Package discovery** - Search and browse Django Packages for third-party packages
- üöÄ **Zero configuration** - No schemas, no settings, just Django
- üêö **Stateful shell** - `shell` executes Python code in your Django environment
- üîÑ **Persistent state** - Imports and variables stick around between calls
- üßπ **Reset when needed** - `shell(action="reset")` clears the session when things get weird
- ü§ñ **LLM-friendly** - Designed for LLM assistants that already know Python
- üåê **Multiple transports** - STDIO, HTTP, SSE support

#### `list_routes`

Introspect all Django URL routes in your project. Filter by HTTP method, route name, or URL pattern to find specific endpoints.

**Example prompts:**

- "Where should I add the new password reset endpoint?"
- "Which view handles user profile updates?"
- "Show me the URL pattern for blog posts so I can add comments"
- "What routes are protected by authentication?"

Each route includes URL pattern, name, namespace, view details (name, type, source file), supported HTTP methods, and class bases for CBVs.

#### `search_djangopackages`

Search [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org) for third-party packages when you need to discover packages for common Django tasks.

**Example prompts:**

- "Find me a good authentication package for social logins"
- "What are the popular REST API frameworks for Django?"
- "I need a package for handling async tasks"
- "Show me admin interface packages"

Results include package metadata like GitHub stars, PyPI info, documentation links, and comparison grid memberships. The search tool supports pagination for large result sets.

Responses are cached locally using Django's file-based cache to minimize requests to the Django Packages API.

#### `get_project`

Get comprehensive information about your Python environment and Django configuration.

**Example prompts:**

- "What version of Django is this project using?"
- "Show me the database configuration"
- "What's the Python version and installed apps?"

Returns Python version, Django version, installed apps, database settings, and debug mode status.

#### `get_apps`

Get all installed Django applications with their models.

**Example prompts:**

- "What apps are installed in this project?"
- "Show me all the models in the blog app"
- "List all custom apps (not Django contrib)"

Returns app labels, names, paths, and associated models for each installed application.

#### `get_models`

Get detailed information about all Django models in the project.

**Example prompts:**

- "What models are available?"
- "Show me the fields for the User model"
- "What's the import path for the BlogPost model?"

Returns model names, import paths, source file locations, and field type information.

#### `get_package_detail`

Get detailed information about a specific Django package from Django Packages.

**Example prompts:**

- "Tell me about django-debug-toolbar"
- "Show me the stats for django-rest-framework"
- "What grids is django-allauth part of?"

Returns package metadata including repository stats, PyPI info, documentation links, and grid memberships.

#### `get_grids`

List all package comparison grids from Django Packages.

**Example prompts:**

- "What package comparison grids are available?"
- "Show me all the grid categories"

Grids are curated comparisons of packages in specific categories like "REST frameworks", "Admin interfaces", etc.

#### `get_grid_detail`

Get a specific comparison grid with all its packages.

**Example prompts:**

- "Show me all REST framework packages"
- "What's in the admin interfaces grid?"
- "Compare authentication packages"

Returns detailed grid information including all member packages for easy comparison.

#### `get_categories`

List all package categories from Django Packages.

**Example prompts:**

- "What package categories exist?"
- "Show me all category types"

Categories organize packages into broad types like "Apps" (installable applications) and "Projects" (complete Django projects).

#### `get_category_detail`

Get details about a specific package category.

**Example prompts:**

- "Tell me about the Apps category"
- "What's in the Projects category?"

Returns category description, metadata, and details about the types of packages it contains.

#### `shell`

Execute Python code in a persistent Django shell session or reset the session.

Imports and variables persist between calls, allowing the LLM to work iteratively - exploring your models, testing queries, debugging issues. Reset the session with `shell(action="reset")` when things get weird.

**Example prompts:**

- "Show me all users created in the last week"
- "Create a test blog post with some sample data"
- "What's the average order value for premium customers?"
- "Run a migration status check"
