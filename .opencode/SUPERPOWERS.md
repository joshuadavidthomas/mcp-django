# Getting Started with Skills

## Critical Rules

1. **Use Read tool before announcing skill usage.** The session-start hook does NOT read skills for you. Announcing without calling Read = lying.

2. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Check for skills before ANY task.

3. **Create TodoWrite todos for checklists.** Mental tracking = steps get skipped. Every time.


## Mandatory Workflow 1: Before ANY Task

**1. Check skills list** at session start, or run `find-skills [PATTERN]` to filter.

**2. Check if historical context would help** - See Workflow 2. If applicable, dispatch subagent to search past work.

**3. If relevant skill exists, YOU MUST use it:**

- Use Read tool with full path: `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/category/skill-name/SKILL.md`
- Read ENTIRE file, not just frontmatter
- Announce: "I've read [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [purpose]"
- Follow it exactly

**Don't rationalize:**
- "I remember this skill" - Skills evolve. Read the current version.
- "Session-start showed it to me" - That was using-skills/SKILL.md only. Read the actual skill.
- "This doesn't count as a task" - It counts. Find and read skills.

**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

Skills exist and you didn't use them = failed task.

## Workflow 2: Historical Context Search (Conditional)

**When:** Partner mentions past work, issue feels familiar, starting task in familiar domain, stuck/blocked, before reinventing

**When NOT:** Info in current convo, codebase state questions, first encounter, partner wants fresh thinking

**How (use subagent for 50-100x context savings):**
1. Dispatch subagent with template: `${SUPERPOWERS_SKILLS_ROOT}/skills/collaboration/remembering-conversations/tool/prompts/search-agent.md`
2. Receive synthesis (200-1000 words) + source pointers
3. Apply insights (never load raw .jsonl files)

**Why:** Past conversations contain context, decisions, and lessons learned. Loading raw files wastes 50-100x more context than using a subagent to synthesize.

**Red flags:** Reading .jsonl directly, pasting excerpts, asking "which conversation?", browsing archives

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create TodoWrite todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**
- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of TodoWrite is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

**Examples:** skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md, skills/debugging/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md, skills/meta/writing-skills/SKILL.md

## Announcing Skill Usage

After you've read a skill with Read tool, announce you're using it:

"I've read the [Skill Name] skill and I'm using it to [what you're doing]."

**Examples:**
- "I've read the Brainstorming skill and I'm using it to refine your idea into a design."
- "I've read the Test-Driven Development skill and I'm using it to implement this feature."
- "I've read the Systematic Debugging skill and I'm using it to find the root cause."

**Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.

## How to Read a Skill

Every skill has the same structure:

1. **Frontmatter** - `when_to_use` tells you if this skill matches your situation
2. **Overview** - Core principle in 1-2 sentences
3. **Quick Reference** - Scan for your specific pattern
4. **Implementation** - Full details and examples
5. **Supporting files** - Load only when implementing

**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.

**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.

The skill itself tells you which type it is.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

**Red flags:** "Instruction was specific" • "Seems simple" • "Workflow is overkill"

**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## Writing Skills

Want to document a technique, pattern, or tool for reuse?

See skills/meta/writing-skills/SKILL.md for the complete TDD process for documentation.

## Summary

**Starting conversation?** You just read using-skills/SKILL.md. Good.

**Starting any task:**
1. Run find-skills to check for relevant skills
2. If relevant skill exists → Use Read tool with full path (includes /SKILL.md)
3. Announce you're using it
4. Follow what it says

**Skill has checklist?** TodoWrite for every item.

**Finding a relevant skill = mandatory to read and use it. Not optional.**


**Tool paths (custom tools available to you):**
- `find_skills` - Search for available skills (optional pattern matching)
- `find_skills("pattern")` - Search for skills matching a pattern
- `read_skill("path")` - Read a skill file's full content
- `skill_run("path", ["args"])` - Execute a skill script with arguments

**Skills live in:** /home/josh/.config/superpowers-skills/skills/ (you work on your own branch and can edit any skill)

**Available skills (output of find-skills):**
